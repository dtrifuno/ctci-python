# The Heavy Pill

Suppose that the $n$-th bottle contains the heavier pills. Put 1 pill from the
first bottle on the scale, 2 pills from the second bottle, and so on, up to
20 pills from the twentieth bottle.

If all pills weighted 1 gram, we would expect the scale to read

$$
  1 + 2 + 3 + \cdot + 19 + 20 = \frac{20\cdot 21}{2} = 210,
$$

however, since the $n$ pills from the $n$-th bottle are 0.1 grams heavier, it
will read $210 + 0.1 \cdot n$ instead. Hence, if $m$ is the scale reading,
$10(m - 210)$ is the number of the bottle containing the heavier pills.

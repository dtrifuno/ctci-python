# 100 Lockers

Note that for an integer $n$, its divisors occur in pairs $(m, n / m)$, unless
$n$ is a perfect square, in which case its square root $b$ is an additional
factor which does not pair with another factor, since $n / b = b$. Therefore,
every locker not numbered with a perfect square will be opened and closed the
same number of times and hence will stay closed, while the perfect squares will
be open: $1^1=1$, $2^2=4$, $3^2=9$, $4^2=16$, $5^2=25$, $6^2=36$, $7^2=49$,
$8^2=64$, $9^2=81$ and $10^2=100$. Hence, $10$ lockers will be open at the
end.

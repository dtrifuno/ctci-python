# Ants on a Triangle

The only way for the ants to avoid each other is if they either all move
clockwise or they all move counterclockwise. The probability of this is
$2\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n}=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n-1}$, where $n$ is
the number of ants, and hence the probability of a collision is the probability of the complement of this event, $1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n-1}$.

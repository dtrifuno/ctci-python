# Apocalypse

We know that each family has a single girl, and therefore to compute the
male-to-female ratio it suffices to compute the expected number of boys per
family. We have

$$
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{E}[B]
=\sum_{i=0}^n \frac{i}{2^{i+1}}
=\frac{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2}{\left(1-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2}
=1,
\end{align*}
$$

by comparison to the Taylor series of $\frac{x^2}{1-x^2}$.

Therefore, the male-to-female ratio is 1.

# Dominos

Note that a two-square domino placed on a chessboard will always cover 1 black
and 1 white square. However, an $8\times 8$ chessboard with diagonally opposite
corners cut off will be missing two squares of the same color, i.e. have
30 squares of one color and 32 of the other. Hence, no more than 30 dominoes can
be placed on the board, and it is not possible to cover it.

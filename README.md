# Python Solutions to _Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th Edition_

These are my Python solutions to the exercises in the book [Cracking the Coding Interview, 6th edition](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)
by _Gayle Laakmann McDowell_.

All solutions are tested using parameterized testing with the [pytest](https://pytest.org/) framework.

## Usage

To download the package and execute all tests, run

```
git clone https://github.com/dtrifuno/ctci-python.git
cd ctci-python
poetry run pytest
```

or, `poetry run pytest PATH/TO/SPECIFIC/TEST` to run only a particular test.
